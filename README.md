# A test project to lear evolutionary algorithms

This project is a small project to learn evolutionary algorithms.
The goal was to create a custom Population class that can be used to evolve a population of neural networks by mixing their weights.

As a test dataset, I used primes below 2^20. The model would try to predict, given the binary representation of a number, if it is a prime or not.

Obviously, due to the chaotic nature of primes, it's difficult to predict them. The model is not very good, but it's a good way to learn about evolutionary algorithms.
